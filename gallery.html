        <p> <i> Fenced</i></p>
          <p> Spring 2015</p>
          <p> Digital Photography </p>
          <p> This piece was one of my experimental works. It plays with how we visualize details, shapes, and color. I took different pictures, such as the flower and the fence in the background, and pieced them together to create this composition.  I wanted <i> Fenced </i> to have an emotional feeling of the emerging hidden beauty. </p>

        <p><i> Roses Are Red</i> </p>
          <p> Spring 2016 </p>
          <p> Digital Photography </p>
          <p> This is one of the pieces from final project for my PHOTO 40 class. I wanted to capture the essence of fire and passion with the red color as the theme for my series. </p>

          <p> Fall 2015 </p>
          <p> Digital Photography </p>
          <p> I took this photo as this was one of the last growing flowers outside my house. My grandmother loves flowers, and when my grandparents moved out, the flowers began to disappear. This photo is a reminder of her and how she brought beauty through flora.

        <p> <i> Cats Invade SJSU </i> </p>
          <p> Fall 2017 </p>
          <p> GIF </p>
          <p> This was part of using Adobe After Effects to create a composition using found footage. The challenge with this GIF was the transition from video to GIF form in Adobe Photoshop; my biggest mistake was not fixing the size before importing, so that loading the composition wouldn't take forever. </p>

        <p> <i> Cats Invade SJSU (video) </i> </p>
          <p> Fall 2017 </p>
          <p> Video </p>
          <p> This is the video version of the GIF, but with added music, shadows, and another kitty. I felt that the GIF was missing an element on the right, so I added another cat to balance it and music to match the playfulness of the video. </p>

        <img src="icanteven.gif" style="width:50%">
          <p> Fall 2017 </p>
          <p> GIF </p>
          <p> This was my first GIF from my ART 75 class. I was assigned to make copies of myself and loop the actions. For this assignemnt, I wanted to make an action-reaction GIF. There were a few challenges to this GIF: cutting myself off in some of the frames and the loop at the end could be more realistic. If I were to do this again, I would give myself more space to work with. </p>

          <p> Spring 2018 </p>
          <p> Video </p>
          <p> Looking back at my ART 75 class last semester, I really enjoyed the timelapse assignment and seeing how we visualize the passage of time. I enjoyed watching this piece because there are different elements and details that one would have to watch again and again to catch all of them. </p>

        <p> <i> Action Sequence </i> </p>
          <p> Fall 2017 </p>
          <p> Video </p>
          <p> For ART 75, I was assigned to create a sequence of actions with a small story to it. I played with camera placement and perspective for this assignment as well as add slow motion in post production. </p>

        <p> <i> Frame As Transition</i> </p>
          <p> Fall 2017 </p>
          <p> Video </p>
          <p> Another video from my ART 75 class that deals with using a mix of our own footage and found footage that relate to each other so that each frame successfully transitions to the next. The challenge with this video was finding the right found videos that will make sense with my videos. I felt that I made my search harder because I used the color red as a theme, and searching for videos with red and that relate to my videos was too narrow, but this video proved otherwise.

        <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/237159124" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe> 
          <p> Fall 2017 </p>
          <p> Video </p>
          <p> I traveled to Marina Park in San Leandro, CA to shoot this timelapse of the sunset at the bay. In one of the frames, the lighting became inconsistent because of the change of camera and the settings. The challenge of this video was not shooting the timelapse, but in post production; I had to edit the lighting to make sure that it was consistent and realistic with the sun setting. </p>
